Description:
    Scaffolds an entire MapFish resource, from model and migration to controller,
    along with a full test suite.

    Pass the name of the model (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'mapfish_resource post title:string body:text published:boolean'
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy mapfish_resource ModelName'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate mapfish_resource post`
    `./script/generate mapfish_resource post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate mapfish_resource WeatherStation name:string position:point`
